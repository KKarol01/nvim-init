# Nvim setup for c++ development with CMake and Clang.
<img alt="image" src="screenshot.png" />

1. Install LLVM
2. Install Chocolatey
3. Install Nerdfont
4. Install Nvim
5. Install Nvim-qt
6. Install CMake
7. Install Ninja
8. Setup system paths
9. Open nvim (not qt)
10. Check if lsp works
11. Start using qt version only from now on.\

No debugging: I do it with Visual Studio. Can compile with empty CMakeLists.txt file, and completion is working even without it, so good for PoF and as a scratchpad.\
